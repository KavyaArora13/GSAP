GUITAR STRING 

this is a cool effect in which we have made a string effect using a svg in this we have used gsap cdn , svg curve path , gsap easing 

in this when we get the mouse in to the comtainer then string will move according to our cursor and when we take our mouse out then string we will to the original position so this makes a cool effect like guitar string
